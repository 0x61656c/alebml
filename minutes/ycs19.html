                    <h4>Yesterday, Pairi interviewed at YC. We were grilled by a panel of really cool people, and we managed to hold our own. I think we feel a lot more comfortable pitching, because almost nothing could be higher pressure than what we just went through.</h4> <h4>Overall, despite the fact that we didn't get in, we both felt that it was an incredibly motivating and positive experience, for Pairi as a company and us as individuals. Thanks to Gustaf and Holly in particular for your feedback!</h4>
