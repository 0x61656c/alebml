                    <h4>Some of the most intelligent people alive are dedicating their working careers to selling advertisements. How can we get people to do more important things?</h4>
                    <h4>Money is a strong motivator, but asymptotic in its effects on behavior. When the most urgent problems arise, will people solve them?
