                    <h2>What We Learned by Interviewing at YC</h2>

                    <h4>On April 16th at 4 a.m. EST I received the following email:</h4>
                    <h5>Thank you for applying to Y Combinator. Your application looks promising and we'd like to meet you in person. Please click here to learn how YC interviews work and to reserve your interview slot.<br><br>

                    We encourage you to read What Happens at YC because it answers most of the questions applicants have had about YC in the past.<br><br>

                    If you want to learn more about YC or our interviews, feel free to ask founders of YC-funded startups. They’re usually happy to answer any questions, although bear in mind that most of them are busy trying to run their companies.<br><br>

                    See you in California!<br><br>

                    —YC</h5>
                    
                    <h4>When our team started working on Pairi, Y Combinator was close to the application deadline. At the last minute, we decided we might as well give it a shot and apply. We weren't expecting to get an interview, but as soon as we did we felt instantly validated.</h4>
                
                    <h4>By 4:30 a.m. we'd booked an Airbnb and two plane tickets. Our Interview was slated for April 30th, meaning we had ~2 weeks to get our company into shape.</h4>
                  
                    <h4>We've moved pretty quickly in the ~2.5 months since starting. Since February, we've logged over 200 customer interviews, iterated on our product three times based on customer feedback, and are on the cusp of launching with just over 50 initial service providers providing their account information. We were always confident in our progress, product, and ability to get shit done. Our primary concern was keeping ourselves in check.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>Our team is entirely technical in background and had zero experience in pitching VCs. We're convinced that we're building something great, and our customer feedback has been incredibly encouraging. Before the interview, we were concerned that we would not be able to convey this and other important information.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>Because we knew going in that this was the most likely failure  mode between the two of us, we practiced relentlessly for our interview--probably more than we should have. Each night we would go to sleep feeling worse about our pitching abilities than before the last day of practice.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>One day we woke up, and somehow we were in a garage in Mountain View, California. The date was April 29th--we had less than 24 hours until our interview.</h4>
                
                    <h4>For two weeks, I'd experienced compounding growth in the pressure I felt to deliver a perfect pitch to our YC interviewers. But for some reason, things changed at this point. I stopped practicing.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>I closed my eyes, and by the time I opened them I was on Pioneer Way, sitting across the table from a forum of my childhood heroes. I had gone in expecting an interrogation. I left feeling that I had been through a discussion.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>I think the interview went well. My co-founder and I were able to field every question in a symbiotic way without stumbling. We felt our answers were strong, but they didn't ask us questions that would have highlighted our strongest points. Of course, something must have went wrong because we didn't get chosen for investment. Their email feedback was mostly enthusiastic, but they were nervous about our market because they had previously funded several companies that had failed in a similar space.</h4>
                    
                    <h4>Despite this, I think the experience was incredibly positive. The preparation process for our YC interview had forced us to consider things about our company that we hadn't before. Going into our YC interview, Pairi felt like a fat side project. Coming out, it feels like a company.</h4>
